## Installation

Install `ruby` (and maybe `rubygems`), and then install `shaddox` (`gem install shaddox`).

Run `shaddox` in the repo directory. Everything is installed relative to `~`.

Make sure to install and use one of the Powerline-enabled fonts included in the `fonts` directory to avoid seeing missing characters with `zsh`.

## Usage

Put any machine-specific `zshrc` commands in `~/.localrc`. It will be sourced automatically by `~/.zshrc`.
